This project uses a decision tree algorithm to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is a standard dataset in machine learning. The dataset contains 150 data points, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The decision tree algorithm is implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. The algorithm is trained on the Iris dataset and then used to classify new data points. The accuracy of the decision tree model is 96%.

The decision tree model can be used to classify Iris flowers in a variety of settings. For example, the model could be used to identify Iris flowers in a botanical garden or to classify Iris flowers in a research study.
